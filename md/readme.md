_This library is being deprecated in Jaanga as the library is now availabe via [CDNS]( https://cdnjs.com/libraries/filesaver.js )_

Showdown is a JavaScript port of [Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown )

## Concept
Calls for Showdown are to be found frequently in the Jaanga repositories.. You will see many files titled 'readme.html'. 
The sole purpose of these files is to read the assiciated 'readme.md' file and display the contents as HTML in the gh-pages branch of the repository.

The intent is to allow the author to write a single file that is viewable both as a Markdown file in GitHub Source and as a web page in GiHub Pages.
