Read Me
=======

## Concept

###Mission
docBrowser is a very simple and very small JavaScript library for browsing GitHub Markdown files via GitHub Pages.

### Vision / Objectives / Desired Features
DocBrowser should be as simple and as small as possible without being too simple and too small.

## The Problem
The primary way of understanding what a Gitub repository is about is via its Read Me file.
GitHub Read Me files are displayyed as HTML if they are written ib GitHub Markdown format.
GitHub also supports the hosting of static web pages that based on HTML. CSS and JavaScript.
The probllem is that if you want data to appear on both the Read Me file and as a web page then you need two copies of the content - ine in Markdown and the other in HTML.

## The Solution 
The docDrowesr library allows you to write the content once - in Markdown format - and has the comtent appear nicely formatted in both systems.


## Road Map

* Internal links/hashes in the content div fully operational
* Menus always highlight apprpriately when internal links are displayed in content div 
* Objectify/name space?
