docBrowser Read Me
==================

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the docBrowser files:

* Web pages hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io/libs/db]( http://jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga/libs/db]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>

## Concept

###Mission
docBrowser is a very simple and very small JavaScript library for browsing GitHub Markdown files via GitHub Pages.

### Vision / Objectives / Desired Features
DocBrowser should be as simple and as small as possible without being too simple and too small.

## The Problem
The primary way of understanding what a GitHub repository is about is via its Read Me files.
GitHub Read Me files are displayed as HTML if they are written in GitHub Markdown format.
GitHub also supports the hosting of static web pages that based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The problem is that if you want data to appear on both the Read Me file and as a web page then you need two copies of the content - one in Markdown and the other in HTML.

## The Solution 
The docBrowesr library allows you to write the content once - in Markdown format - and have the content appear nicely formatted in both systems.

## Features
* Fast, simple and small
* Happily works with both Markdown and HTML
* Displays an 'Instant Message' from a single designated source, read at run time, and displays it on all instances 


## Road Map

* Menus always highlight appropriately when internal links are displayed in content div 
* Objectify/name space?
