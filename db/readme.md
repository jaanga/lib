## Concept

Mission
docBrowser is a very simple and very small library for browsing GitHub Markdown files via GitHub Pages as well as locally.

## Vision / Objectives / Desired Features

_The following are some of the thoughts going on while this app and these web pages are being developed. This text is very much a work in rapid progress._

### Easy to enhance

* Create something that screams: 'tweak me till I twerk.' 'Open up the hood, pick up your wrench and screwdriver, and take me apart.'


### Support Lots of interactive 3D

* If this is 'your 3D happy-place' then it better be dripping with luscious interactive 3D


### Support lots of images and videos

* Don't forget the Handicapped  
* Not everybody has cutting edge technology


### Apps are from Venus. Code is from Mars.

* two links for every repo - one for app view - one for source view  
* And one for the read me.
* html files are about using the apps
* moving around github is about looking at source code
* seamless transitions between running apps, parsing source code and viewing read me files 


### Embrace GitHub

* Fully utilizes GitHub spirit/features


### Effortless Navigation

* Moving around is as easy as changing TV channels. You can go to the next channel by clicking. Like a multipane file tree viewer.
* You *do not* have have to go and return, go and return, go and return.
* Browse apps and code easily.
* Each screen shows images of the contents
* Handles folders and files

### WORM revisited

* Write once, read anywhere
* A guiding precept is: 'Write once. Read many.'
* This has nothing to to with WORM drives.
* In this case meaning the ability to view files in a well-formatted fashion in either a GitHub source code repository or available as a GitHub-hosted web-page.


### Accept Quantity

* Make it really easy and really fast to look after and curate lots of projects and c=very simple to add new projects.


### Compatibility

* Markdown interpreter 
* Compatible with airDoodle 
* Totally embraces the GitHub thing

### Oriented toward programmers 

* Monospace font
* Left justified
* IDE-like feeling
* Snarky attitude


### Oriented toward Designers / Code is for dummies


### Easy to Maintain

* Lends itself to progressive improvements
* Ability to go through lots of files - one by one - and make incremental improvements that evolve as the improvements are made and then can be easily carried0back to the previously enhanced files.
	- or putting it another way: nothing prevents the above from happening.


### 100% JavaScript  

* Use the ability of JavaScript to create and it HTML and CSS.
* Write with a single thought process

## Road Map

* Move the code of the HTML file and into a JavaScript file
* Objectify/name space?
* Add universal IM capability

## Issues /Bugs

* Make it easier to carry out global updates

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the jaanga files:

* Code hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>
