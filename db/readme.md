Read Me
=======

## Concept

###Mission
docBrowser is a very simple and very small JavaScript library for browsing GitHub Markdown files via GitHub Pages.

### Vision / Objectives / Desired Features
DocBrowser should be as simple and as small as possible without being too simple and too small.

## The Problem
The primary way of understanding what a Gitub repository is about is via its Read Me file.
GitHub Read Me files are displayyed as HTML if they are written ib GitHub Markdown format.
GitHub also supports the hosting of static web pages that based on HTML. CSS and JavaScript.
The probllem is that if you want data to appear on both the Read Me file and as a web page then you need two copies of the content - ine in Markdown and the other in HTML.

## The Solution 
The docDrowesr library allows you to write the content once - in Markdown format - and has the comtent appear nicely formatted in both systems.


## Features

_The following are some of the thoughts going on while this app and these web pages are being developed. This text is very much a work in rapid progress._

### Easy to enhance

* Create something that screams: 'tweak me till I twerk.' 'Open up the hood, pick up your wrench and screwdriver, and take me apart.'


### Support Lots of interactive 3D

* If this is 'your 3D happy-place' then the library better be open to luscious interactive 3D


### Support lots of images and videos

Yet:

* Don't forget the handicapped  
* Not everybody has cutting edge technology


### Apps are from Venus. Code is from Mars.

* Two links for every repo - one for app view - one for source view  
* And one for the read me.
* HTML files are about using the apps
* Moving around github is about looking at source code
* Needs seamless transitions between running apps, parsing source code and viewing read me files 


### Embrace GitHub

* Fully utilizes GitHub spirit/features


### Effortless Navigation

* Moving around is as easy as changing TV channels. You can go to the next channel by clicking. Like a multipane file tree viewer.
* You *do not* have have to go and return, go and return, go and return.
* Browse apps and code easily.
* Each screen shows images of the contents
* Handles folders and files

### WORM revisited

* Write once, read anywhere
* A guiding precept is: 'Write once. Read many.'
* This has nothing to to with WORM drives.
* In this case meaning the ability to view files in a well-formatted fashion in either a GitHub source code repository or available as a GitHub-hosted web-page.


### Accept Quantity

* Make it really easy and really fast to look after and curate lots of projects and c=very simple to add new projects.


### Compatibility

* Markdown interpreter 
* Compatible with airDoodle 
* Totally embraces the GitHub thing

### Oriented toward programmers 

* Monospace font
* Left justified
* IDE-like feeling
* Snarky attitude


### Oriented toward Designers / Code is for dummies


### Easy to Maintain

* Lends itself to progressive improvements
* Ability to go through lots of files - one by one - and make incremental improvements that evolve as the improvements are made and then can be easily carried0back to the previously enhanced files.
	- or putting it another way: nothing prevents the above from happening.


### 100% JavaScript  

* Use the ability of JavaScript to create and it HTML and CSS.
* Write with a single thought process

## Road Map

* Objectify/name space?

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the jaanga files:

* Code hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>
