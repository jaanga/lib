docBrowser Read Me
===

## Concept

###Mission
docBrowser is a very simple and very small JavaScript library for browsing GitHub Markdown files via GitHub Pages.

### Vision / Objectives / Desired Features
DocBrowser should be as simple and as small as possible without being too simple and too small.

## The Problem
The primary way of understanding what a Gitub repository is about is via its Read Me file.
GitHub Read Me files are displayed as HTML if they are written ib GitHub Markdown format.
GitHub also supports the hosting of static web pages that based on HTML. CSS and JavaScript.
The probllem is that if you want data to appear on both the Read Me file and as a web page then you need two copies of the content - ine in Markdown and the other in HTML.

## The Solution 
The docBrowesr library allows you to write the content once - in Markdown format - and has the comtent appear nicely formatted in both systems.

## Features
* Fast, simple and small
* Happily works with both Markdown and HTML
* Displays an 'Instant Message' from a single designated source, read at run time, and displays it on all instances 

* Two links for every repo - one for app view - one for source view  
* And one for the read me.
* HTML files are about using the apps
* Moving around github is about looking at source code
* Needs seamless transitions between running apps, parsing source code and viewing read me files 

_The following are some of the thoughts going on while this app and these web pages are being developed. This text is very much a work in rapid progress._

### Easy to enhance

* Create something that screams: 'tweak me till I twerk.' 'Open up the hood, pick up your wrench and screwdriver, and take me apart.'


### Support Lots of interactive 3D

* If this is 'your 3D happy-place' then the library better be open to luscious interactive 3D


### Support lots of images and videos

Yet:

* Don't forget the handicapped  
* Not everybody has cutting edge technology

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the docBrowser files:

* Web pages hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io/libs/db]( http://jaanga.github.io/libs/db/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga/libs/db]( https://github.com/jaanga/libs/tree/gh-pages/db "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


## Road Map

* Add web font capability
* Objectify/name space?

## Issues /Bugs

* Move the code of the HTML file and into a JavaScript file
* Add universal IM capability
* Make it easier to carry out global updates
