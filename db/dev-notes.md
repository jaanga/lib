Dev Notes

Links in the content dev should be absolute
Why?
Because the `blob/gh-pages` parts mean that relative links go to the wrong place depepenig on github.io and .com
May need three links

- show source code
- display read me
- run app 

Note to self: Would hiding links on the .com-side read me files help?

Getting links in the content `DIV` to work appropriately is turning out to be a bit of a fun issue. 
Will teach me more about attaching events and dynamic languages.
